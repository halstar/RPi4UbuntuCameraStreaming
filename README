Found no out of the box script/binary to stream a regular Raspberry Pi camera, out of my Raspberry Pi 4 running Ubuntu, to get it displayed on a remote PC.

As getting it work required some efforts, I am sharing here my working solution.

## Environment

- Tested only on Ubuntu Mate 20.04.3 LTS (a.k.a. Focal Fossa),
- No guarantee this would work also on any other distro,

## How to

- Install OpenCV's python package: "pip3 install opencv-python"
- Check/Update /boot/firmware/config.txt to make sure the following is present:
-- start_x=1
-- gpu_mem=16
- In case you modified config.txt, reboot,
- Run the camera streaming script: "python3 RPi4UbuntuCameraStreaming.py"
- On the PC, launch your favorite web browser at the following address:
-- http://192.168.0.40:8000/index.html
-- (replace 192.168.0.40 with your own Raspberry Pi's IP or hostname)
